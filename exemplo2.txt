My name is Yoshikage Kira, I'm 33 years old, and I work as a salaryman in Japan. I live in a quiet town called Morioh, where I lead a peaceful life. However, I have a secret: I am a serial killer. My goal is to live a quiet life, but I am constantly pursued by the police and other Stand users. I have a Stand named Killer Queen, which allows me to turn anything I touch into a bomb. I am always looking for new victims, but I must be careful not to attract too much attention. My life is a constant struggle between my desire for peace and my dark urges.
